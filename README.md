# MyDashboard


# Approach

I followed a strict one-hour timebox and focused on building a clean, minimal dashboard using Angular components, services, and simple charts. I used AI to generate initial scaffolding—mainly boilerplate and basic chart configuration—and then manually simplified and adjusted the code to avoid unnecessary complexity. My goal was to keep the code clear, readable, and easy to validate without relying on AI for logic. I intentionally avoided over-optimizing or introducing advanced patterns so that the final result would be maintainable and aligned with the requested layout. I ensured that I understood and reviewed every line of code before completing the solution.
